# Node SHell

[![Build for NodeOS](http://i.imgur.com/pIJu2TS.png)](http://nodeos.github.io)

`nsh` is a basic POSIX compliant shell that will run without having `bash` or
another process tidy things up first. It's also `require()`able and embedable on
other projects like [blesh](https://github.com/piranna/blesh), and has a
collection of basic commands as build-in functions running on the same shell
process powered by [Coreutils.js](https://github.com/piranna/Coreutils.js).
